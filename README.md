# COVID19 Data Analysis

## Description
This is an analysis I did to play and discover info contained in the [COVID19 R package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/COVID19/index.html).
I used R and Tidyverse packages to dig deep into the data and try to understand what was happening in these wild times.
